** The Deal **
If you run `sing.py` you get sung to you the song as played here: http://soundcloud.com/ben-newhouse/jason-mrazs-lucky-as-performed

It's pretty awful/hilarious.  I haven't though to much on how to make vickie sing according to rythm in a way that was syntactically simple.

** Requirements **
* OSX (for the say command)
* csound (I'm using 5.x, probably anything recent will do, I installed just from the csound OSX binaries)
